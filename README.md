Hi there I am Varun.

This project is developed to predict the price of gemstone from a given dataset.

This dataset is downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e8.

I would recommend you to create an environment and install the setup.py file.

After doing so, run app.py.

Then go to localhost:8000 in your browser to see the web app.

Thats it, bye!!!
